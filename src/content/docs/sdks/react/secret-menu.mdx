description: Toggle feature flags at runtime with the Flags.gg secret menu.

## Overview

The secret menu is a debug UI built into the React SDK that lets you toggle feature flags at runtime without using the dashboard. It's activated by a customizable key sequence.

## How It Works

1. The secret menu is enabled in the Flags.gg dashboard under your environment settings
2. A custom key sequence is configured (e.g., a Konami-style code)
3. When the sequence is entered in the browser, the secret menu appears
4. You can toggle any flag on or off
5. Changes persist in `localStorage` under the key `flagsgg:overrides`

## Features

- **Pagination** — Handles large numbers of flags
- **Reset** — Clear all local overrides and return to API values
- **Runtime toggling** — No deploy needed to test flag combinations
- **Local persistence** — Overrides survive page reloads

## Enabling the Secret Menu

1. Go to the Flags.gg dashboard
2. Navigate to your project → agent → environment
3. Enable the secret menu option
4. Configure a custom key sequence

The `FlagsProvider` automatically loads the secret menu configuration from the API when it's enabled.

## Use Cases

- **Development** — Test flag combinations without modifying the dashboard
- **QA** — Verify behavior with different flag states
- **Demos** — Toggle features during presentations
- **Support** — Enable debug features when troubleshooting
