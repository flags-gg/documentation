## Memory Cache

The Ruby SDK uses an in-memory cache with configurable TTL:

```ruby
client = Flags::Client.builder
  .with_auth(auth)
  .with_memory_cache
  .build
```

The memory cache:
- Provides fast read performance
- Is thread-safe for concurrent access
- Has data cleared on application restart
- Automatically refreshes based on the API-provided TTL

## Cache Refresh

The API response includes a TTL value that determines how frequently the SDK re-fetches flags. This happens automatically in the background — no manual configuration is needed.

## Fallback Behavior

When the API is unavailable:

1. The circuit breaker opens after 3 consecutive failures
2. Flag checks return the last cached value
3. If no cached value exists, `enabled?` returns `false`
4. After a 10-second cooldown, the SDK attempts to reconnect

This means your application continues to function even when the Flags.gg API is down.
