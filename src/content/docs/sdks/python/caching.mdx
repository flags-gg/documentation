## SQLite Cache (Default)

By default, flags are cached in a SQLite database at `/tmp/flags.db`.

```python
# Default SQLite cache
client = new_client(
    project_id="...",
    agent_id="...",
    environment_id="...",
)

# Custom SQLite path
client = new_client(
    project_id="...",
    agent_id="...",
    environment_id="...",
    sqlite_path="/var/data/flags.db",
)
```

Benefits:
- Persists across application restarts
- Thread-safe with proper locking
- Automatic cleanup of expired entries

## Memory Cache

For short-lived processes or when persistence isn't needed:

```python
client = new_client(
    project_id="...",
    agent_id="...",
    environment_id="...",
    use_memory_cache=True,
)
```

Benefits:
- Faster read performance
- Lower overhead
- No file system dependencies

## Cache Refresh

Cache data is automatically refreshed based on the TTL provided by the Flags.gg API. No manual configuration is needed.
