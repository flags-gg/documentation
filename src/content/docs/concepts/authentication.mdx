## Credentials

Every SDK requires three identifiers to authenticate with the API:

| Header | Field | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `X-PROJECT-ID` | `projectId` | Your project identifier |
| `X-AGENT-ID` | `agentId` | The agent (app/service) identifier |
| `X-ENVIRONMENT-ID` | `environmentId` | The environment identifier |

These are sent as HTTP headers on every request to the API.

## Getting Your Credentials

1. Log in to [flags.gg](https://flags.gg)
2. Navigate to your project
3. Select the agent and environment
4. Copy the IDs from the settings panel

## SDK Usage

Every SDK accepts auth credentials during client initialization:

```go
// Go
client := flags.NewClient(
  flags.WithAuth(flags.Auth{
    ProjectID:     "your-project-id",
    AgentID:       "your-agent-id",
    EnvironmentID: "your-environment-id",
  }),
)
```

```python
# Python
client = new_client(
    project_id="your-project-id",
    agent_id="your-agent-id",
    environment_id="your-environment-id",
)
```

```jsx
// React / Next.js
<FlagsProvider options={{
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  agentId: "your-agent-id",
  environmentId: "your-environment-id",
}}>
```

See individual SDK pages for the complete setup.

## Security

- Credentials identify which flags to serve — they do not grant write access
- Use different environment IDs for production, staging, and development
- Never commit credentials to version control; use environment variables or secret managers
